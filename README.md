## *Project Description*
###### This project simulates a game of Uno and abides by standard Uno rules. It is played via terminal output. At the start, the user will be prompted with a multiplayer option; they will also get to choose the number of players. Once they choose the number of players, they can name all of them. Afterwards, the players will take turns and will have one of two options - to either draw from the draw pile or play a card. In order to play a card, a player will need to specify its order which will be displayed at every turn. Once one player has one card left, they can declare "Uno!". When one player has no cards left, they are declared the winner and the game ends.
