## *Project Description*
###### This project simulates a game of Uno and abides by standard Uno rules. It is played via terminal output. At the start, the user will be prompted with a multiplayer option; they will also get to choose the number of players. Once they choose the number of players, they can name all of them. Afterwards, the players will take turns and will have one of two options - to either draw from the draw pile or play a card. In order to play a card, a player will need to specify its order which will be displayed at every turn. Once one player has one card left, they can declare "Uno!". When one player has no cards left, they are declared the winner and the game ends.

## *Launch Instructions*
>###### 1. Open the terminal.
>###### 2. Change directory to the directory containing the Old_MACdonald repository.
>###### 3. Type in ```javac Woo.java```
>###### 4. Type ```java Woo```

## *Special Cards*
######-Reverse: When played, the order of the players will be reversed.
######-Skip: When played, the next player will be skipped.
######-Draw Two: When played, the next player draws two cards from the deck and is skipped.
######-Draw Four: When played, the next player draws four cards and is skipped. The player who put the card down also chooses the color of the next card.
######-Wild Card: When played, the player who put the card down chooses the color of the next card. The next player's turn is NOT skipped.

#### *Something to keep in mind*
######If a player has two cards and one can be played, they must type in "Uno," and then play their card. If they do not, they will draw two cards.
